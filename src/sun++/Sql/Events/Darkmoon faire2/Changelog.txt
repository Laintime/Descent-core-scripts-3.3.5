Revision 16:
	- Blastenheimer 5000 Cannon scripted. This is in the /extras/ folder and to use it you have to use the
	  patch 'Gameobject_RemoveModifyEvent.patch' in the /patch/ folder or it won't compile.
	- Cannon still does not animate, and this can only be used in ElwynnForest right now until I find a way
	  to make it work in multiple locations. Can anyone script this to animate? Me love you long time. ;)

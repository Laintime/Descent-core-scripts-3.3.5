Darkmoon Faire:
================================================================

TODO:
- The creatures with waypoints should walk continuously in a circle, but the movetype in creature_spawns doesnt work.
- Quests need to be re-writen. The quests.sql doesn't apply correctly yet, so don't use it.
- Cannon works but I still can't figure out the animation for it.
- Tonks have a long way to go... Anyone willing to help?
- NPCs don't offer proper quest text when speaking with them.
- NPCs set to formation should stop when one of them in a group is spoken to.
	Instead the other just keeps walking and the one spoken to is stuck.
		- This has sort of been fixed. The NPCs just keep walking now.
- The 2 Active Carnies (Script) should have an offset timer so they don't
	speak at the same time.
- The NPC Speech should be random. (min/max)

- Terokkar Forest: Not Released
